\subsection{Adapted SAGAT}
\label{subsec:results_adapted_sagat}

In this subsection the Sagat questionnaire is analyzed. Its result's may give an ideia of the mental map the participant is drawing

The Shapiroâ€“Wilk normality test on the Table \ref{tab:shapiro_sagat_score} shows that these data are normally distributed, with a p-value higher than 0.05, then it is possible to perform a t-test to guarantee that the "blind" sample is different then the "sight" sample and that is verified by the t-test's p-value that is lesser than 0.05 as show in the Table \ref{tab:ttest_sagat_score}.

The Table \ref{tab:sagat_average} presents these averages by each participant on each scenes.

\input{Resultados/Sagat/Tabelas/sagat_average}

To be able to verify the impact of the methods on the "blind" sample, the Table \ref{tab:sagat_average_group} and the box plot on the Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_sagat_scene} presents the grouped average mental demands of the blinded and the sighted participants on each scenes and the box plot of the distribution of those averages.

The Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_sagat} and Table \ref{tab:sagat_average_group} is shown the global average of each group of participants
