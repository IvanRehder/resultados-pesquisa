The Shapiroâ€“Wilk normality test shows that these data are normally distributed, with a p-value higher than 0.05, then it is possible to perform a t-test to guarantee that the "blind" sample is different then the "sight" sample and that is verified by the t-test's p-value that is lesser than 0.05.

The Table \ref{tab:time_average} presents these averages by each participant on each scenes and the Figure \ref{fig:time_average} shows these data plotted.

To be able to verify the impact of the methods on the "blind" sample, the Table \ref{tab:time_average_group} and the box plot on the Figure \ref{fig:time_blind_boxplot} and \ref{fig:time_sight_boxplot} presents the grouped averages of the blinded and the sighted participants on each scenes and the box plot of the distribution of those averages.

A similar analyzes is possible to be made with the "sighted" sample but it results in different values as conclusions as show in the Figure \ref{time_sight_boxplot}. Through this figure is possible to see that ...

Analysing these time averages is possible to say that ...
