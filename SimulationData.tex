%Unity3D was programmed to record two different information as performance evaluation, they were:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \nameref{subsec:results_time};
%    \item \nameref{subsec:results_collsions}.
%\end{itemize}
Unity3D was programmed to record the time that each user spent in each scene. It expected that the the time analysis show the following observation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The scene made with the white cane would be the fastest and with the less number of impacts; \\ 
    Since the participant is already used with this method, it is safe to assume that with the others methods the participant would go slower and hit more furniture on the way.
    \item Comparing both scenes made with the same method, the second one would have the fastest and with less impact; \\
    Not only this is expected but also that is the intention on having two scenes with each method.
\end{itemize}

%As it has done with the time results, a Shapiroâ€“Wilk normality test with the number of collisions %has a p-value higher than 0.05 showing that these data are normally distributed. The t-test of %"blind" sample versus the "sight" sample has a p-values lesser 0.05, than these sample are %statistically different.
%
%The Table \ref{tab:collisions_average} presents the average collisions of each participant that %happened on each scenes and the Figure \ref{fig:collisions_average} shows these data plotted.
